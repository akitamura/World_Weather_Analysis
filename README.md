# World_Weather_Analysis_Challenge

Challenge Background
  Creating code that adds data to the original database with functions that includes a pop-up marker to the map.
  Code will also include the addition of rainfall and snowfall description for the last hour.
  A filter was also added for temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing.
  Finally, a directions layer was added to the Google map.
  
Challenge Objectives
  1. Using nested try-except blocks.
  2. Use Pandas methods/attributes on DataFrame or Series.
  3. Create a new DataFrame from an API search with new weather parameters.
  4. Filter DataFrames based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions.
  5. Create pop-up markers on a Google map from a filtered DataFrame.
  6. Add directions layer on Google map between cities in the filtered Data Frame.
